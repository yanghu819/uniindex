# Active Baseline

`schedule-fix-layout-integ` is the only active code line for fullvocab runs.

## Active configs

- Long baseline: `configs/flm_joint_work_fullvocab_tsw075.yaml`
- i2t power short sweep:
  - `configs/flm_joint_work_fullvocab_short_i2tp20_tsw075.yaml`
  - `configs/flm_joint_work_fullvocab_short_i2tp40_tsw075.yaml`
  - `configs/flm_joint_work_fullvocab_short_i2tp60_tsw075.yaml`
- i2t repeats short sweep: generated from `configs/flm_joint_work_fullvocab_short_i2tp40_tsw075.yaml` by `./run.sh sweep-i2t-repeats`

## Current best result

- `text_sequence_weight = 0.75`
- `image_to_text_text_time_power = 4.0`
- `stage2_joint_repeats = 2`
- `stage2_text_to_image_repeats = 2`
- `stage2_image_to_text_repeats = 6`
- Remote eval path: `/fangxueji/Projects/PG/uniindex/worktrees/schedule-fix-layout-integ/runs/fullvocab_long_tsw075_i2tr06/20260417T110458Z-eval/metrics.json`
- Metrics:
  - `image_to_text_exact_match = 0.12109375`
  - `image_to_text_token_accuracy = 0.35990528808208366`
  - `image_to_text_label_accuracy_constrained = 0.15625`
  - `text_to_image_accuracy = 0.94140625`
  - `unconditional_consistency = 0.8125`

## Canonical execution

- Use `./run.sh prepare|stage1|stage2|eval --config ...`
- Use `./run.sh sweep-i2t-power` for the 2/4/6 short sweep over `image_to_text_text_time_power`
- Use `./run.sh sweep-i2t-repeats` for the 4/6/8 short sweep over `stage2_image_to_text_repeats`
- `run.sh` exports `PYTHONPATH=$ROOT/src`, so every worktree resolves the local code instead of an unrelated editable install
- `configs_generated/` is runtime-only and should stay untracked

## Recent text-weight sweep

- Short sweep summary: `/fangxueji/Projects/PG/uniindex/worktrees/schedule-fix-layout-integ/runs/text_weight_sweep/20260420T033259Z/summary.json`
- Short winner: `text_sequence_weight = 1.0`
  - `image_to_text_label_accuracy_constrained = 0.109375`
  - `text_to_image_accuracy = 0.13671875`
- Long promotion summary: `/fangxueji/Projects/PG/uniindex/worktrees/schedule-fix-layout-integ/runs/text_weight_long/20260420T035303Z/summary.json`
- Long promotion metrics for `text_sequence_weight = 1.0`:
  - `image_to_text_exact_match = 0.06640625`
  - `image_to_text_label_accuracy_constrained = 0.1171875`
  - `text_to_image_accuracy = 0.84765625`
  - `unconditional_consistency = 0.671875`
- Decision: do not promote `text_sequence_weight = 1.0`; keep the current `0.75` baseline.

## Next experiment

Do not continue increasing `text_sequence_weight` without a new reason. The next low-cost check should be eval-only sampling sensitivity on the current best checkpoint, especially `sampling.steps` and image-to-text text schedule, before another long training run.
